      Cape Town has a complex and fascinating history shaped by Dutch, British, and indigenous influences. The city was first established by Dutch settlers in 1652 as a supply station for the Dutch East India Company.
      Over the centuries, it developed into a melting pot of cultures and traditions, evident in its architecture, languages, and customs.

      Cape Town played a significant role during the apartheid era and was the site of major resistance movements. Today, it's a city that embraces its past while looking toward a more inclusive future.
      From the historic District Six Museum to Robben Island – where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned – visitors can explore the depth of the city's cultural heritage.
